# ProductCategories


Unit of Work Pattern API with Consile App UI
Xunit Test Cases


Hi

I have used Unit Of work Pattern for the project, with the data first migration.

The Generic repository and Entity framework provides all the necessary tools to create and update the product and categories. So I didn't used the stored procedure to fetch the values form database. But the stored procedures are in the script file attached.

I have used constraint in the Sql to check for the SKU values and category Id and used Fluent Validator in the API.

I've used Nlog for logging its writing in the SQL Log tables as well as in "C:\ProjectLogs\ProductCategories\internal-nlog.txt" so please create this on your PC to see the logs

I have used Xunit test cases. Any questions let me know.
