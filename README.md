Unit of Work Pattern API with Consile App UI
Xunit Test Cases


Hi 

I have used UnitOf work Pattern for the project, with the datafirst migration.

The gemeric repository and Entity framework provides all the necessary tools to create and update the product and categories.
So i didnt used the stored procedure to fetch the values form database.
But the stored procedures are in the script file.

I have used constraint in the SQl to check for the SKU values and category Id
and used Fluent Validator in the API.

Ive used Nlog for logging its writting in the SQL Log tables as well as in "C:\ProjectLogs\ProductCategories\internal-nlog.txt"
so please create this on your PC to see the logs

I have used Xunit test cases.
Any questiones let me know.
